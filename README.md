This repo has the implementation of the 25 challenges from [Advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Setup

Is necessary to have Elixir 1.10 or higher installed.

To install the dependencies, run:

```shell
$ mix deps.get
```

## To run the tests

After the setup step, to run all tests, run the command:

```shell
$ mix test
```

## Code style check

In order to run the lint tool, is necessary to do the setup step first, then run the command:

```shell
$ mix lint
```

## Challenges

The list of solved challenges are available below.

In order to run the code and get the correct answer run the task mix `day<number-of-the-challenge>`,
for example:

```shell
$ mix day1
```

This will print the result at stdout.
